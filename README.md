<p>This is a working demo of SignalR using the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 with MVC5 (.NET 4.5)</li>
<li>SignalR</li>
<li>Bootstrap 3.3, which is mobile-first, hence responsive by nature</li>
<li>Kendo UI 2014 Quarter 3 Release</li>
</ul>

<p>The SignalR demonstration page is the home page of the application.  All of the demo functionality can be accessed from there.  You can choose to show your data edits, or just those of others.  </p>
