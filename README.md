<p>This is a working demo of SignalR using the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 with MVC5 (.NET 4.5)</li>
<li>SignalR</li>
<li>Bootstrap 3.0, which is mobile-first, hence responsive by nature</li>
<li>Kendo Web UI 2013 Quarter 3 Release</li>
</ul>

<p>The SignalR demonstration page is the home page of the application.  All of the demo functionality can be accessed from there.  You can choose to show your data edits, or just those of others.  </p>
